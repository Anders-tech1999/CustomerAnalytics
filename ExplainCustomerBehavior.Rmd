##### 0. Problem & objective (we use the datafile from Hair et al., Multivariate Data Analysis, Pearson)
HBAT is a manufacturer of paper products who sells products to two market segments: the newsprint industry and the magazine industry. The current market is very competitive, so the manufacturer wants to understand how its customers perceive the company and make purchasing decisions, in order to enforce customers loyalty. The manufacturer commissioned a study asking its customers to complete a questionnaire on a secure website. In total, 100 customers - purchasing managers from different firms - buying from HBAT completed the questionnaire. The data consist of three main pieces of information:
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

â¢	A 1st type of information is available from HBATÌs data warehouse and includes information on:
-	customer type in terms of length of purchase relationship (X1)
-	industry type(X2)
-	size of the customer(X3)
-	region of the customer(X4) 
-	distribution system(X5)

â¢	The 2nd type of information is collected based on the online questionnaire and includes consumersâ perceptions of HBAT Ìs performance on 13 attributes using a continuous 0-10 (line) scale with 10 being âExcellentâ and 0 being âPoorâ. The 13 attributes are:
-	X6 Product quality
-	X7 E-commerce
-	X8 Technical support
-	X9 Complaint resolution
-	X10 Advertising
-	X11 Product line
-	X12 Salesforce image
-	X13 Competitive pricing
-	X14 Warranty and claims
-	X15 Packaging
-	X16 Order and billing
-	X17 Price flexibility
-	X18 Delivery speed

â¢ The 3rd type of information relates to purchase outcomes and business relationships:
-	satisfaction with HBAT, future purchase intention etc.  (X19-X22)
-	whether the firm would consider a strategic alliance/partnership with HBAT (X23).

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

The dataset (HBAT.sav) consists of data for n = 100 customers. Each observation contains information on 23 variables described above. Consistent with the marketing theory, there is an underlying factor structure in the data. When designing the study, the company has clearly 4 types of factors in their mind. They expect that the customer satisfaction is determined by the following four type of perceptions: perceptions about the product value, perceptions about the marketing actions, perceptions about the customer service and perceptions about the technical support.These factors are abstract constructs that can be measured in a survey using multi-item scales. The following items define each construct:  

- X18 Delivery Speed 
- X9 Complain resolution
- X16 Order and Billing,
to express âCustomer serviceâ 

- X11Product line
- X6 Product quality
- X13 Competing pricing,
to express âProduct valueâ

- X12 Salesforce image
- X7 E-commerce
- X10 Advertising, 
to express âMarketingâ 

- X8 Technical support 
- X14 Warranty and claims,
to express âTechnical supportâ

##### 1. Data uploading, etc. 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
```{r}
library(foreign)
data <- read.spss("HBAT.sav", to.data.frame=TRUE)
library(haven)
HBAT <- read_sav("HBAT.sav")
View(HBAT)
```

```{r}
library(haven)
HBAT <- read_sav("HBAT.sav")
View(HBAT)
```


```{r}
#install.packages("lavaan", dependencies=TRUE)
library(lavaan)
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
variable.names(data)
VariableLabels <- unname(attr(data, "variable.labels"))
# data.label.table <- attr(sav, "label.table") # if you load it with read_sav()
summary(data)
```

##### 2. Check if Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) applies

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Look at their the coefficient of linear correlation
cormatrix <- cor(data[, c(7:19)])
round(cormatrix, 2)
# Observe that most of the variables have a high correlation (>0.40 as a rule-of-thumb) with at least one of the others. x15 does not have decent correlation with any of the others; the analyst may decide to delete x15. If the analyst does not discover the problem here, it will be evident a few steps later. 
```



```{r eval=FALSE}
#install.packages("psych")
# Bartlett Sphericity Test. The null hypothesis is that the data dimension reduction is not possible. 
# If p-value < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and apply FA. This test is sensitive to N.
library(psych)
print(cortest.bartlett(cor(data[, c(7:19)]), nrow(data[, c(7:19)])))
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Kaiser-Meyer-Oklin Test (KMO). MSA overall should be .60 or higher to proceed with factor analysis
library(psych)
KMO(data[, c(7:19)])
```
x15 does not share much with the other variables. x6 does share 87% with other variables. Go primarily with overall MSA = 0.61

&nbsp;
&nbsp;


##### 3. Apply EFA with Common Factor Analysis
```{r eval=FALSE}
#install.packages("nFactors")
  # Extracting as many factors as variables and check eigenvalues 
        library(nFactors)
        ev <- eigen(cor(data[, c(7:19)]))
        ev$values
  # the first 4 factors have an eigenvalue >1
        plot(ev$values, type="line")   
  # the screeplot suggests 3 factors
  # we go for 4 factors and see later if necessary to reduce this number



  fit1 = factanal(~ x6 + x7 + x8 + x9 + x10 + x11 + x12 + x13 + x14 + x15 + x16 + x17 + x18, factors = 4, data = data, lower=0.1, rotation = "varimax") #we dont have responsevariable bevause of interdependence
  # factanal() function can analyze raw data or a correlation matrix or covariance matrix; 
  # factanal() applies Maximum Likelihood by default. 
  print(fit1, sort=TRUE, cutoff=0.2)


# OUTPUT
        # Uniquenesses: #has to be small, if it big, the variable doesnt share anything with the rest which it bad.R ONly preints uniqueness which is the contrary to Communality

# GUIDELINES FOR OUTPUT INTERPRETATION
      # To ease interpretation, very low loadings (<.1, <.2) are not displayed
      # According to the guidelines:
        # High loadings (>0.6 or > 0.7) are expected for the items 
        # Items with high cross-loadings should be removed 
        # communalities should be >50 to retain the item in the analysis
        # factor loaadings should be high to retain the item in the analysis

# Now, the p-value associated with the chi-square statistic 
# 0.0626. This result is much promising. 
# The analysis can still be refined by exclussing x11. Some researchers
# make a compromise and keep x11 in the model if the scale for the corresponding
# item was validated previously in the literature. 

# Last step: Naming the factors 
# x9, x16, x18 load high on Factor 1 ; we call it Customer service
# x7, x10, x12 load high on Factor 2; we call it Marketing
# x8 and x14 load high on Factor 3; we call it Technical support
# x6, x11, x13 load high on Factor 4;  we call it Product value

# OBS. Item x13 was negatively formulated in the questionnaire. 
# It should be reversed if the analysis is ussed further in the CFA and SEM.
```

Next, we set up a confirmatory factor analysis to confirm the measurement model (CFA). 
FinaÃ¦Ã¦y, given the measurement model has been examined and validated in the CFA analysis, we set up a SEM model, to test the structural relationships between the four constructs identified and the customersÂ´ likelihood to continue doing business with the company (X19-Satisfaction, X20-Likelihood of recommendation and X21-Likelihood of future purchase).

# There are several potential causes (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0049124112442138). Here,eliminating the problematic item x11, will solve the problem.  


# Before doing that, I ask for the modification indices as a last check
modificationindices(fit, sort = T, minimum.value = 10, op = "~~")
# MI reveal that x11 is correlated with x16 and x18; it means that x11 has substantial cross-loading on two factors (as in EFA). Cross-loading goes against one of the principles of unidimensionality in SEM. We delete x11 from the analysis and re-run CFA.

# 1.) Examine the model fit; guidelines for a good model: 
#     CFI >.90, TLI>.90, RMSEA< 0.08, SRMR <.0.08. 
#     Some sources require CFI >.95, TLI>.95, RMSEA< 0.05, SRMR <.0.05. 


# 2). Examine the loadingss significance, size and sign 
#     It is desirable to have high and significant loadings - 
#     reflecting items convergent validity. In the output 
#     standardized loadings are in the last column "Std.all""

    # In one factor 2, competitive pricing (x13) and product quality (x6)
    # have opposite signs. It means that the product quality and competitive 
    # pricing vary together, but move in direction oposite to each other. 
    # Perceptions are more positive whether product quality increases
    # or price decreases. This trade-off leads to naming the factor product value. 
    # When variables have different signs, we need to be careful to reverse one when creating
    # summated scales or using further in SEM analysis. 
    # given our variable is using a 0-10 scale , to reverse it we take:

    discriminantValidity(fit, merge=TRUE)
    # Output:

    # Based on Fornell & Larcker (1981), the square root of each constructÂ´s AVE should have a greater value 
    # than the inter-constructs corelations (or AVE > corr^2). Let us check that:
    reliability_out = reliability (fit)
    AVEs = reliability_out[5,]
    sqrtAVEs = sqrt(AVEs)
    sqrtAVEs
    # Comparing the inter-constructs correlations (see "est"" column in the output of
